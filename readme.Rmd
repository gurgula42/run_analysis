Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset and merges those columns with the dataset.
Merges the two datasets. 
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
Labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
Creates a tidy data set that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each each activity subject and .
The end result is written into the file sum_all.txt.
